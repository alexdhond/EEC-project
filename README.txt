Thesis: The effects of land-use change on ant and dung-beetle biodiversity in Neotropical ecological communities


This folder contains all scripts, data, and figures used in my analysis. NOTE: The PREDICTS datafile (titled "UPDATED.rds") is available only for the purpose of reproducing my analyses, and should not be shared.


This folder contains the following sub-folders:

1. R Scripts. This contains the R Markdown scripts I used to run my analysis. The scripts in this file are numbered in the order they were (and should be) run in. The purpose of each script is described on the first few lines at the top of each script. Scripts that are not numbered involved code that was not necessary for the main analyses.

2. Data and Intermediate Files. This contains the PREDICTS database extract, and CSV files that I generated and loaded later in my analyses.

3. Main Text Figures. This folder contains all figures that are found in the main text of my thesis.

It also contains the R.Proj file, and this README.
